# Introduction to Myself
## As a programmer
I began to learn programming languages in 2019. The first language I learned is *C++* and it was super hard for at that time even now it is still not easy. I found most of the interest when I was learning *HTML* and *CSS* because it is something that can be visually seen by my friends who has no idea of programming, thinking it as something cool.
